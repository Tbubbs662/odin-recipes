            <li>1 Teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 Large eggs(beaten)</li>
            <li>1 Cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>2 Cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 Teaspoons kosher salt (to season meat)</li>
            <li>2 Teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 Teaspoon cayenne</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Gravy:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 Cup pan drippings(reserved after making the country fried steak)</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1/4 Cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 Cups whole milk</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper(to taste)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <h4>Prepare the steaks:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><p><strong>Pound the steaks:</strong>Flattening one steak at a time, 
                place steak into a large resealable plastic bag and use a meat tenderizer 
                mallet to pound them to a uniform ¼ inch thickness.</p></li>
            <li><p>Sprinkle a little salt over both sides of each steak. Preheat oven to 200°F.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Prep the coating:</strong>Using two flat bottomed dishes large 
                enough to fit the tenderized steaks, whisk together the eggs and buttermilk 
                in one dish and combine the flour with the salt and seasonings in the other.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Coat the steaks:</strong>Press both sides of each steak into the 
                flour mixture. Shake off excess. Dredge both sides into the egg mixture. Shake 
                off excess. Then, set steak in the flour mixture for a second time, ensuring 
                that the entire surface is well coated by shaking it around. Flip to coat both 
                sides, but take care not to pull off any coating. Transfer to a clean plate or 
                large cutting board while you finish remaining steaks.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Fry the steaks:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><p><strong>Heat the pan:</strong>Over medium high heat, heat pan with oil until 
                the oil reaches a temperature of 350°F.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Cook steak:</strong>Carefully place one prepared steak in the hot oil. 
                Use a large metal spoon to transfer excess hot oil in the pan to the top of the steak. 
                Fry until you see the edges of the steak turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. Use tongs 
                to carefully turn the steak in the pan and cook for another 2 minutes (no need to spoon 
                hot oil on top of already cooked side).</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Transfer to rack:</strong>Use tongs to lift fried steak out of pan and allow 
                any excess oil to drip off. Transfer to a paper towel lined plate to absorb any excess 
                grease and then a wire rack placed over baking sheet and keep warm in preheated oven until 
                all steaks and gravy are finished and ready to serve.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Fry remaining steaks:</strong>Follow same process to cook remaining steaks and 
                transfer each on to the rack in the oven to keep warm until done. Adjust heat, if needed, 
                to maintain an oil temperature of 350°F.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Make the gravy:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><p><strong>Reduce the amount of oil:</strong>Transfer all but ¼ cup of the drippings to a 
                glass or metal bowl. Do not discard in case more is needed later. Add butter to pan.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Make the roux:</strong> Reduce heat under pan to medium low. Sprinkle the 
                flour over the hot oil and whisk to combine. Flour should absorb all of the oil and 
                will turn golden brown over the low heat when whisked continually. If mixture seems 
                too greasy once mixed, add a bit more flour. If mixture is to dry, add additional 
                reserved drippings. Cook about 5 minutes while continually whisking, until the roux 
                is a light brown.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Finish the gravy:</strong>Combine milk and heavy cream. Slowly pour into 
                roux, whisking the entire time. Continue to heat and whisk until gravy reaches desired 
                consistency. If gravy doesn't thicken, slowly increase heat. Taste and season with salt 
                and pepper.</p></li>
        </ol>
